# Overview of Microfluidic Devices and Pinched Flow Fractation

* **Introduction:** To generally describe a uFluidic device, A uFluidic device is like a circuit board for liquids. However, instead of electrical traces, small channels and tubes transport, sort, and mix reagents together. These channels are as small as 60 micrometers (the width of a human hair). Applications of uFluidic device models include: medical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, tissue engineering, and environmental testing. In tiny spaces like micro-compartments within a ufluidic device, there are different behaviors of fluids. At large scales, gravity and inertia determine how fluids act. However, in small compartments, surface tension becomes the dominant force influencing how fluids move and interact with surfaces due to the high surface-to-volume ratio. In addition, fluids in micro-chambers do not experience turbulent flow (i.e., mixing); the flow in these micro-chambers is laminar. Laminar flow is often visualized as parallel layers or “sheets” that slide smoothly past the adjacent layers without mixing. The absence of turbulent mixing is bad in microfluidic devices because mixing is crucial for carrying out biological assays effectively without localized concentrations affecting the outcome. Some mixing occurs through molecular diffusion in laminar flow, but it is inherently slow and relies on the random, gradual movement of molecules over short distances. To increase the cross-sectional path for mixing, an effective method is to increase the path length in a serpentine path style. Another way to achieve greater mixing is through chaotic advection, a phenomenon distinct from turbulence which is characterized by chaotic flow. To explain further, individual fluid particles deviate from the straight laminar flow lines due to underlying microscale disturbances or structures in the flow. Geometries within a uFluidic model that induce chaotic advection include corners, herringbone/chevrons, obstacles, and intersections. Moving to the topic of ufluidic sorting, ufluidic sorting can be used for isolating and analyzing biological particles such as cells, viruses, and extracellular vesicles. This project focuses on a passive particle separation method called pinched flow fractionation (PFF).  Microfluidic flows are stable and predictable, allowing for innovative particle separation methods that are impractical at larger scales. “Passive microfluidic devices achieve particle separation without external forces, relying on interactions between particles/interparticle forces, fluid flow, and microchannel structure. This approach enables the fine-tuning of parameters such as intake flow rate, fluid viscosity, and particle size for precise separation” (Ashrafizadeh, 2024).
* **What is Pinched Flow Fractation? How does it work?:** “Pinched flow fractionation (PFF) uses hydrodynamic forces to continuously guide particles into distinct paths, maintaining smooth, non-turbulent flow. Typically operating at high flow rates, these devices quickly separate particles in milliseconds to seconds, efficiently handling large volumes while preventing undesired mixing, especially for very small particles” (Ashrafizadeh, 2024). For accurate and effective sorting, pinched flow fractionation is crucial to incorporate into the uFluidic model. The laminar flow needs to be split into a pinched section and a broad section. The center particles will follow the stream line, and larger particles will follow the stream line that is slightly further from the wall. Larger particles try to break their streamline because they have lower pressure in their streamline. It is important to have three outlets breaking off from thebroad-widthh section because it is necessary to get rid of the bottom liquid so it doesn’t negatively affect the top streamline. The applications of PFF in microfluidics include separating biological particles, cells, blood components, separating metal particles, and utilizing polymers. Due to its precise capability to segregate and categorize particles based on their size, PFF has a significant use in the biomedical area. In addition to its use in biomedicine, the PFF may also be used in environmental monitoring and analysis, namely in the area of nanoparticle separation and pollution detection. The PFF devices use the concepts of intertial focusing and simple passage to efficiently separate nanoparticles of different sizes and enable the identification and measurement of contaminants in water sources, air samples, and industrial waste. This skill is very helpful for environmental scientists and policy makers who want to monitor and decrease pollution levels, safeguard ecosystems, and promote public health (Ashrafizadeh, 2024).

# Instructions on How to go from 3D Printed Mold to the Final Device 

* **Based on the article, “Rapid Prototyping of Cell Culture Microdevices Using Parlylene-Coated 3D Prints” this is an explained step-by-step process for going from the 3D printed mold to the final microfluidic device.** 
* **CAD Model:** Design the microdevice using Fusion 360 or another CAD software. Convert the design to STL format to be compatible with the 3D printing software. Use PreForm software (Formlabs) to slice and generate G-code for printing. 
* **Print and Cure Mold:** Print the design using a Form 3 SLA 3D printer (Formlabs). Select an appropriate resin type (e.g., clear, black, grey, or high temperature). After printing, wash the mold with isopropyl alcohol until it is clean. Cure the mold using a UV curing chamber at 60C for 60 seconds. 
* **Parylene Coating of the 3D Printed Mold:**  Place the cured mold into a Labcoater PDS 2010 parylene deposition machine. Deposit a layer of parylene-C using 2 grams of parylene-C according to the machine’s automatic settings. If the mold will be used directly for cell culture, sterilize it using gamma irradiation. 
* **Cast PDMS:** Mix polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer and curing agent in a 10:1 weight ratio. Pour the mixture over the parylene-coated mold. Degas the mixture in a vacuum chamber for 30 minutes. Cure the PDMS by placing it in an oven at 80C for 3 hours. Carefully demold the PDMS device from the coated mold. 
* **Plasma Bond Glass Slide:** Use a PlasmaFlo PDC-FMG plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma) for plasma treatment. Place the PDMS device and a glass coverslip in the plasma clearer. Expose them to oxygen plasma for a few seconds to activate the bonding. Immediately press the PDMS device onto the glass slide to form a permanent seal. If necessary, sterilize the final device in an autoclave before use. 
* **This workflow ultimately ensures high-fidelity replication of the mold while maintaining biocompatability and ease of PDMS demolding due to the parylene coating.**

# Discussion

* **Resin printed molds are often coated with parylene prior to casting the PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane). PDMS is an elastomeric thermoset that is mixed together and poured into the mold, and it is a member of the silicone family, hence the rubber-like consistency. Here is some information to help explain why resin-printed molds are coated with parylene prior to casting the PDMS.  “The deposition of a thin layer of parylene, a polymer commonly used for medical device applications, renders 3D prints biocompatible and allows them to be used as master molds for elastomeric device fabrication. When placed in culture dishes containing human neurons, regardless of resin type, uncoated 3D prints leached toxic material to yield complete cell death within 48 hours, whereas cells exhibited unifor viability and healthy morphology out to 21 days if the prints were coated with parylene” (O’Grady, 2021). This strategy makes microfluidics more accessible to the biomedical research community. For my microfluidic sorter, a hypothetical application is particle separation based on particle size. Specifically, microfluidic sorting can be used for analyzing and isolating biological particles such as cells, extracellular vesicles, and viruses.**

# Why My Model is Conducive to Sorting

* **For this project, we were asked to design a chip that is capable of sorting particles with pinch flow fractionation that fall within two size ranges: 1) 125 - 150 micrometers and 2) 425 - 500 micrometers. The geometry of my chip includes two inlets, a pinched section, a broad section, and three outlets for the particle sorting as well as a drain channel to reduce flow resistance. The size range of particle separation is mostly determined by specific distribution of flow rates in the input branches, and the quality of separation is influenced by the geometry of the pinch section and the transition from the pinch section to the broad section. In addition, the equation of each particle at exit is important: Y0 = (wp - d/2) wb/wp, shown in Figure 1, which explains the relationship between the particle diameter and the exit location of the particle in the broad section. It is crucial to note that if the channels are too close to the size of the particles, the device can clog. Because of this, I made sure that the pinch and broad section depths were at least 1.2 - 1.5 times the diameter of the largest particle, and I made the inlet and outlet channel depths 1.7 times the diameter of the largest particle. The pinch section of the model is where the particles and liquid flow meet together from the inlets to then shoot out into the broad section, so it is crucial for the pinch section to be very narrow, but still accommodate the particle size. Therefore, my pinch section is .750mm, or 750 microns wide, which is 1.5 times the diameter of the largest particle. It is also important for the broad section of the model to be as wide as possible, so I made it 19mm. I measured from the bottom edge of the broad section to make the dimensions for where my outlets should be for the small particle outlet and the large particle outlet. The small particle outlet should be higher than the large particle outlet. After calculating the precise locations, the small particles should come out 17.1 - 17.4mm from the bottom edge of the broad section, and the large particles should come out 12.6 - 13.61mm from that same edge. For my model, I made a slanted cut out in reference to the precise locations of the particle flows to help direct the small particles to the upper particle outlet, for the larger particles to be directed to the lower particle outlet, and for the non-particle flow to be able to drain at the lowest outlet. In addition, the beginning of each outlet is equidistant from the exit of the pinch section, and the entire broad section is the same depth to help ensure that the outlets receive the same flow rate to prevent disruptions to the streamlines and maintaining proper separation. After the results of testing the mold, I could have implemented more sorting outlets off of the broad section to more efficiently sort the small and large particles from one another.**
