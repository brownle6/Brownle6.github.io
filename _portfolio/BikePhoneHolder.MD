# Description

* **What is Top-Down Modeling?**  Unlike bottom-up modeling, where components are designed independently and then assembled during the creative process, top-down modeling is a design approach used in CAD that designs the individual components within the context of the assembly after the overall assembly is devised. Top-down modeling was helpful for this assignment because it made the building process of multiple parts so much easier because you actively reference the other components in your design during the sketching and modeling processes. Instead of going into separate CAD files to check/reference the dimensions of other parts or having to import numerous files into one design, top-down modeling solves both of these problems by keeping all of that information in one place. 

# Rationale Behind Design and Assembly Instructions

* **For my bike phone holder’s design, I wanted to make it as simple and efficient as possible, while also ensuring that the printed design wasn’t too bulky. I tried to keep the proportions of my parts only as big as needed for the functionality of the phone holder to work. A criteria of the project was for the holder to be able to rotate/swivel the phone between portrait and landscape orientations, so a rotation mechanism was required for this to be made possible. The method I chose was to use a detent mechanism, which uses a ball bearing and spring that work together to hold the phone properly in place at certain angles as they engage with notches in the design. According to Dr. Florian, “This provides tactile feedback and prevents unintended movement while allowing easy rotation when enough force is applied.” My final detent mechanism works very well, but I had to experiment with different length springs until I found the perfect match that created enough of a recoil with the ball bearing during each rotation. 
The set up/assembly of my model is fairly simple to put together and take apart. The phone case mounts onto the lid of the rotating component of the detent mechanism, the lid screws directly onto the main compartment of the detent mechanism so that the spring and ball bearing don’t fall out, and the main part of the detent mechanism mounts directly to the front handle bar mount piece. The other side of the handle bar mount piece is placed on the back side of the handle bar, and attached to the front piece of the handle bar mount with screws and nuts.**

# Printing Process

* **During the printing process, I had to reprint the detent mechanism component because I originally accounted for the wrong width of the spring, so the spring didn’t fit in its extruded compartment when I first tried to screw on the lid. In addition, I had to modify the shape of the part that attached directly to the bike handle bars because I originally made it too big, causing the phone holder to slip out of place. I printed all but one of the components in PLA so that the holder had proper rigidity to support the weight of my phone. The only part I printed in TPU was the phone case aspect of the design so that I could bend the corners of the case to allow my phone to fit properly.**
